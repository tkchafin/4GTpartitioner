This is a description of the files in this directory:
- example_1_genome.fasta : Example FASTA-formatted "genome" for use with example_1.vcf* files
- example_1.vcf : Uncompressed .VCF file 
- example_1.vcf.gz : Compressed .VCF file produced using bgzip (see README.md file for exact command)
- example_1.vcf.gz.tbi : Tabix index file for the .vcf.gz (see README.md)
- example_1_alignment.fasta : Example FASTA-formatted "genome alignment" file, showing the full alignment from which the example_1_genome.fasta and example_1.vcf* files were derived. This file is included because some similar programs (e.g. Rmincutter.pl) take a full alignment as input.
